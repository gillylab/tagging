My PhD work on Dosidicus gigas: imperfect code and practices but sharing all the same.

Nov 13, 2016. After 4+ years, trying to make sense of all of these files so they can be used again. 

Start with these files. The first is the flow for all the analyses, it calls the second two, as well as others. I would recommend saving the whole folder somewhere that Matlab already looks for file paths, and then running compareTags.m line by line to see what you're looking for...

- compareTags.m
- compareTagsFigs.m
- compareTagsFigsBothLocs.m
